        <h2 class="article-body-heading">Choose a telecom provider</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There are several telecom providers in Singapore
          such as Singtel, Starhub, and M1. Research the different providers and
          their plans to choose the one that best suits your needs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-body-heading">Purchase the SIM card</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You can purchase a SIM card at any convenience store
          or telecom provider's store in Singapore. Make sure to bring your
          passport as you will need it to register for the SIM card.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-body-heading">Register the SIM card</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After purchasing the SIM card, you will need to
          register it. This is a mandatory process in Singapore, and failure to
          register your SIM card may result in it being deactivated. To
          register, simply follow the instructions provided with your SIM card
          or ask the salesperson for assistance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-body-heading">Insert the SIM card</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Once your SIM card is registered, insert it into
          your phone. If you have any issues inserting the SIM card, refer to
          your phone's user manual.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-body-main-heading">Top up your balance</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To make calls and use data, you will need to top up
          your balance. You can do this by purchasing top-up cards at
          convenience stores or online. Alternatively, you can set up auto
          top-up with your telecom provider.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-body-heading">Activate the SIM card</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To activate your SIM card, dial the activation code
          provided with your SIM card or follow the instructions provided by
          your telecom provider. Once your SIM card is activated, you should be
          able to make calls and use data.
        </p>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That's it! With your newly activated SIM card, you
          can now stay connected and enjoy your travels in Singapore without
          worrying about losing touch with your loved ones or missing out on
          important updates.
        </p>

        <h2 class="article-body-heading">Prices</h2>

        <p class="article-body-para">
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The cost of a SIM card in Singapore can vary
          depending on the telecom provider and the plan you choose. Generally,
          prepaid SIM cards are more cost-effective for travelers as you can
          control your usage and top up as needed. The prices for a basic
          prepaid SIM card in Singapore can range from SGD 8 to SGD 15
          (approximately USD 6 to USD 11). This includes a certain amount of
          data, calls, and SMS. You can also purchase add-ons such as additional
          data or international roaming packages, which may come at an
          additional cost. It's important to note that some telecom providers
          may offer special promotions or discounts for tourists, so it's worth
          checking their websites or visiting their stores to inquire about any
          ongoing offers. Overall, purchasing a SIM card in Singapore is a
          convenient and affordable way to stay connected during your travels.
          Just make sure to research the different options available and choose
          the one that best suits your needs and budget.
